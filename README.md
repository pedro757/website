# My Portfolio (WIP)

This is my portfolio, I'm making this readme to show the steps I've taken to
create it.

## The UI/UX Desing

This project is based on the figma, So i'm using figma to create a prototype first and then bring all my ideas to
life, although I'm thinking that I need an UI/UX expert.

### Why am I using A prototype tool to desing my own portfolio?

I'm using a prototype tool because a I want better results, I'm tired of having
a cool idea for my projects that I forget a few moments later.
